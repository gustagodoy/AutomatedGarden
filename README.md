# Irrigation System

In this project I'll be demonstrating an automatic irrigation system. 

Through moisture sensor reading, will be verified the need of watering the soil and, a DHT22 sensor will read the ambient temperature and humidity.

The following components were used in this project:

- Arduino Uno
- Protoboard
- 20x4 LCD Display
- LM393 - I2C Soil Moisture Sensor
- DHT22 - Temperature and humidity sensor
- 10k Î© Resistor
